This application is built as a demonstration of ability in Java for consideration by employers. It is my first solo application. :)

This application is built as a demonstration of ability in Java and problem solving for consideration by employers. It is my first solo application. :)


Its goal is to serve as a means to help a small team manage tasks on a small scale farm or small hobby farm.

Functionality is built in for weather observation, planning tasks in accordance, monitoring progress and completion of tasks. As well, there is functionality for basic messaging between team members.

The following are production notes and updates. Thank you for reading this and for checking out the project. Cheers!

Was not receiving desired results and so began re-evaluting means to parse data from JSON response. New discoveries ARE returning desired results and so formatting and of desired data has begun. Hooray!
Next steps will include continued formatting followed by setting the data to a label to be displayed on  "Stations" sub window.

"Never forget those who gave their all in order for us to enjoy what we have today."

Began work on methods for Weather sub window. Started with api inclusion for reading data out of a station. Verified obtaining the field input through print out. Next will be a string variable formatted to accept the field values and insert into the url address used for the API call. 

Following will be parsing the returned JSON keys and applying them to a java map and variables in order to log data to the upcoming weather data base and display conditions.

Have decided to hold off on transferring to GIT hub for source control when I have already started with BitBucket.

Have not seen a great difference in functionality and really appreciate that BitBucket isn't trying to log my every sign in or machine. Call it what you want but Microsoft freaks me out.

Will begin next day of development work with pushing current build into repository.

Relocation mostly complete. Began adding UI for Stations function and fleshed out more of the functionality.
Will be migrating the project to GitHub from BitBucket in near future as per current industry standard. Would love to see that change.

Implemented web viewer with buttons for switching between online weather services. Created WebServicesController and updated WebServices.fxml

Beginning reasearch on JSON parsing. Plan is to implent
Open Weather Map API for stations section. Then it will be on to creating database for logging weather and comparing data. Followed by methods for observations.

Development will be on hold while relocating.

Happy Cinco de Mayo! Vivo la Mexico!

Began creating user interface for Weather sub window.
 
// Created InstrumentsFXML, InstrumentsController, ObservationsFXML, WebServicesFXML and WebServicesController.

// Implemented WebServicesFXML and InstrumentsFXML in WeatherController in order to switch displays on Weather SubWindow.

//Added instruction to WeatherCSS

! Continue with implementing webview in WebServices and corresponding buttons !

! Look at creating a method in order to quickly create scene changes !

Base template of GUI completed and uploaded to Git.

// A Main Window for launching 3 sub-windows for Weather, Chores and Inventory with buttons for selecting sub window and minimize and close. 

// Considering swapping Inventory functionality for basic messaging functionality as database integration will be demonstrated in the application through the other sub sets.

Would still like to develop inventory functionality, but at a later time.
